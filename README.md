How to analyse customer churn EDA

Results from the exlploratory data analysis:

Customer churn measures the metrics when customers stop using the service/product.

Consequences are usually that sales decreases and you have to note that acquiring a new customer is more expensive than maintaining a customer.

It is also important to get feedback that why customers leave.

Churned/all customers = Churn rate %

Histogram analysis shows the distribution in terms of time and payments. Categorical analysis shows the distribution by gender, seniority, contract, demographic factors, contract type and payment method.

To sum up:

Customers with higher total fees are less likely to leave the customer base.

Long-term customers who pay more than average are loyal.

That's why it's important to reward long-term customers with incentives and other reward methods.
